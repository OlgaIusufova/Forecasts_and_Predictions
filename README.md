# Forecasts and Predictions.
## Project_10. The gym chain Model Fitness.

The gym chain Model Fitness is developing a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.

One of the most common problems gyms and other services face is customer churn. How do you know if a customer is no longer with you? You can calculate churn based on people who get rid of their accounts or don't renew their contracts.
However, sometimes it's not obvious that a client has left: they may walk out on tiptoes.

Churn indicators vary from field to field. If a user buys from an online store rarely but regularly, you can't say they're a runaway. But if for two weeks they haven't opened a channel that's updated daily, that's a reason to worry: your follower might have gotten bored and left you.

For a gym, it makes sense to say a customer has left if they don't come for a month. Of course, it's possible they're in Cancun and will resume their visits when they return, but's that's not a typical case. Usually, if a customer joins, comes a few times, then disappears, they're unlikely to come back.

In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles. Your task is to analyze them and come up with a customer retention strategy.

***You should:***
- Learn to predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer
- Draw up typical user portraits: select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features
- Analyze the factors that impact churn most
- Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service:
   - Identify target groups
   - Suggest measures to cut churn
   - Describe any other patterns you see with respect to interaction with customers
